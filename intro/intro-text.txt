This is Winslow Homer!  

Winslow Homer is a wild baby capuchin monkey who lives in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica with his big family of 30 other monkeys.  Winslow is Dali the alpha female's baby, so he's quite popular with the other monkeys -- a little prince charming!

---------------------------

Every day, Winslow Homer and his big group set out in search of food.  Capuchins eat mostly fruit, and they have to spend most of their day travling between food patches -- they travel about 3.5 km (2.2 miles) every day, on average.

Scientists have been studying Winslow's family since 1990, to learn about the monkeys' behaviors and understand how they evolved to be so smart.

This map shows one rather typical day in Winslow's life, with real data collected by scientists.

Winslow Homer wakes up

On January 24 2014, Winslow and his family woke up right here at 5:44 AM.  The scientists have to make sure to get to the monkeys before they wake up -- they start moving right away, and they're hard to find once they're lost!

Follow along to see where Winslow went and what he did!
